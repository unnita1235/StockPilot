## 2. Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)

### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)
**[Screen: StockPilot logo + tagline]**
> "StockPilot is a full-stack inventory management platform I built to solve a real problem: retailers losing revenue from stockouts. Let me show you how it works."

### Scene 2: Login & Dashboard (0:15 - 0:40)
**[Screen: Login page → Dashboard]**
> "The platform uses JWT authentication with role-based access. After logging in, you see the real-time dashboard showing total items, stock value, low-stock alerts, and activity trends. All data updates live via WebSocket."

### Scene 3: Inventory Management (0:40 - 1:15)
**[Screen: Inventory table → Add item → Edit item]**
> "The core feature is inventory management. You can add items with SKU, category, pricing, and stock thresholds. The table supports search, filtering by category, and switching between table and grid views. Watch what happens when I update stock..."

### Scene 4: Real-time Updates (1:15 - 1:35)
**[Screen: Two browser tabs side by side]**
> "Here's the real-time feature. I have two browser sessions open. When I add stock in one, the other updates instantly via WebSocket. No refresh needed. Alerts trigger automatically when stock drops below threshold."

### Scene 5: Analytics & Predictions (1:35 - 2:00)
**[Screen: Analytics page → AI predictions]**
> "The analytics module shows trends, stock movement patterns, and generates reports. The AI prediction engine analyzes historical data to forecast demand and recommend reorder points—this is what drives the 78% stockout reduction."

### Scene 6: Technical Architecture (2:00 - 2:30)
**[Screen: Architecture diagram or code snippets]**
> "Under the hood: Next.js 15 with App Router on the frontend, NestJS with TypeScript on the backend, MongoDB Atlas for data, Socket.IO for real-time, and multi-tenant architecture. The backend is deployed on Railway, frontend on Vercel, with full CI/CD."

### Scene 7: Closing (2:30 - 2:45)
**[Screen: GitHub repo + live URL]**
> "StockPilot demonstrates full-stack TypeScript proficiency, real-time systems, predictive analytics, and production deployment. Check it out at the links below. Thanks for watching!"
