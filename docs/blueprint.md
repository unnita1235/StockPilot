# **App Name**: StockPilot

## Core Features:

- Item Management: Add, edit, and remove items from the inventory, including details like name, description, and current stock level.
- Stock Level Tracking: Real-time tracking of stock levels for each item, providing an up-to-date view of inventory status.
- Low Stock Alerts: Configure and display low stock alerts for critical items, prompting timely reordering. LLM tool analyzes historical stock data to predict when an item will likely run low, and factors this into the alert level. This helps prevent stockouts, while ensuring that the correct threshold for low stock is maintained to prevent needless ordering.
- Category Grouping: Assign an inventory category (such as raw material, packaging material, or product for sale) to each item. The display should be groupable based on these.
- CSV Export: Enable exporting inventory data to CSV files for reporting and data analysis.
- Search and Filter: Implement search and filtering capabilities to quickly find specific items or categories within the inventory.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#708090) to give a professional, business-like, but not too imposing impression.  It also can relate to feelings of reliability and intelligence.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), visibly related in hue to the primary color, but very desaturated to create a neutral background.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#8A2BE2), as a non-obtrusive highlight tone. Violets/purples give a feel of subtle distinction to the UI without demanding too much attention.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font, for both headers and body, because the application needs to be clean and business-like.
- Simple, modern icons to represent different inventory items and actions.
- Clean and organized layout with clear visual hierarchy, using cards or tables to display inventory items.
- Subtle animations for user interactions, such as adding or updating items.
